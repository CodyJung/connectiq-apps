Pip-Boy 30
----------
Not on the Connect IQ App Store because this is probably copyrighted, but you can get it here:

[Pip-Boy 30 for Vivoactive](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codyjung-ciq-builds/PipBoy30-vivoactive.prg)

[Pip-Boy 30 for FR920XT](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codyjung-ciq-builds/PipBoy30-fr920xt.prg) (Currently suffers from a device bug that offsets the background)

[Pip-Boy 30 for Epix](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codyjung-ciq-builds/PipBoy30-epix.prg) (Colors are currently incorrect)

A watchface for the Vivoactive similar to the Pip-Boy 3000 from the Fallout series of games. Mostly static.
The chest health bar represents battery. The right leg health bar represents % of daily step goal. The left leg health bar is the move bar.
The time is displayed below.
